Assignment 4 - Direct Messaging Chat

Has a functional login screen that asks for username and password inputs (if username does not exist, it will automatically create a new user with the provided password, otherwise if password is incorrect user cannot login) 
as well as an IP address (automatically set to local host if no input is provided). When a user messages another user that exists, the contact will be automatically loaded into the user's contact list. Program does have features
to change users and server address after login but I did not implement those features as a focus so there are most likely bugs with it/may not operate as intended.
